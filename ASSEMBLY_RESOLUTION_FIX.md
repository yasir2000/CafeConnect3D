# Compilation Issues Resolution Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. CoffeeMachine Method Signature Errors ✅
- **Problem**: Methods were using `NetworkPlayer` instead of `PlayerController`
- **Problem**: Method names didn't match interface (`GetInteractionText` vs `GetInteractionPrompt`)
- **Solution**: Updated all method signatures to match `BaseInteractable` interface:
  - `CanInteract(PlayerController player)`
  - `GetInteractionPrompt()`
  - `Interact(PlayerController player)`

### 2. Missing Meta File ✅
- **Problem**: Orphaned .meta file for deleted NetworkManager.cs
- **Solution**: Removed the orphaned meta file

### 3. Assembly Cache Cleanup ✅
- **Problem**: Corrupted script assemblies causing Burst compiler errors
- **Solution**: Cleared Library/ScriptAssemblies and Library/StateCache

## Remaining Issue: Assembly-CSharp-Editor Resolution

The Burst compiler error is a common Unity issue that usually resolves automatically. Here's what to do:

### Immediate Steps:
1. **Close Unity completely**
2. **Reopen Unity** - This will trigger fresh compilation
3. **Wait for compilation to complete** - Don't interrupt the process
4. **Check Console** - Compilation errors should be resolved

### If Error Persists:
1. In Unity: **Jobs** → **Burst** → **Enable Compilation** (uncheck to disable)
2. Or in **Edit** → **Project Settings** → **Player** → **Scripting Define Symbols**, add: `UNITY_BURST_DISABLE`

### Why This Happens:
- Burst compiler tries to process assemblies before they're fully compiled
- Assembly-CSharp-Editor.dll is auto-generated and should appear after successful compilation
- Our script fixes removed the root causes of compilation failures

## Expected Result:
After Unity reopens and recompiles, all scripts should compile successfully without errors.
