## 🔧 **Method 3: Alternative Unity Version**

Sometimes specific Unity builds have MonoManager bugs:

### **Try These Versions:**
- **Unity 2022.3.44f1** (one version back)

## 🎯 **Method 4: Command Line Import**

### **Force Unity to rebuild everything:**
```bash
# Navigate to Unity installation
cd "C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\2022.3.45f1\Editor"

# Launch with force reimport
Unity.exe -projectPath "C:\CafeConnect3D" -forceReimport -createProject
```

## 🛠️ **Method 5: Safe Mode + Manual Assembly**

### **If Unity opens at all:**
1. **Hold SHIFT while opening project**
2. **Choose "Safe Mode"**
3. **Window → Package Manager → Reset Packages to defaults**
4. **Assets → Reimport All**
5. **Edit → Project Settings → Player → Scripting Backend → IL2CPP**

**Run it as Administrator, then restart your computer.**
